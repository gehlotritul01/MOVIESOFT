Instructions to run on your machine: (tip :p)

Since it is a react app when you will clone the repository make sure to run first remove all the json.lock ,yarn.lock and nodemodules if present and then re install it using 
"npm install".

After the installation is done give "npm start" command on your terminal and the app will start in the local host :).



Thank you so much :)
